## The scope of this article

Jimmer supports [trigger](../advanced/trigger), which is divided into binlog trigger and transaction trigger.

Using transaction triggers will cause jimmer's modification operations to generate more and more complete queries to simulate triggers.

Several scenarios have been discussed in this article, and the generated SQL will be discussed for each scenario, all on the premise that transaction triggers are not used.

## Basic usage

Delete statement usage is as follows

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
BookTable book = BookTable.$;

int affectedRowCount = sqlClient
    .createDelete(book)
    .where(book.name().eq("Learning GraphQL"))
    .execute();
System.out.println("Affected row count: " + affectedRowCount);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val affectedRowCount = sqlClient
    .createDelete(Book::class) {
        where(table.name eq "Learning GraphQL")
    }
    .execute()
println("Affected row count: $affectedRowCount")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The generated SQL is as follows:
```sql
delete 
from BOOK as tb_1_ 
where tb_1_.NAME = ?
```

## Use table joins

The Delete statement supports table joins, like this

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
BookTable book = BookTable.$;

int affectedRowCount = sqlClient
    .createDelete(book)
    .where(book.store().name().eq("MANNING"))
    .execute();
System.out.println("Affected row count: " + affectedRowCount);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val affectedRowCount = sqlClient
    .createDelete(Book::class) {
        where(table.store.name eq "MANNING")
    }
    .execute()
println("Affected row count: $affectedRowCount")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Finally, three SQL statements are generated:

1. 
    ```sql
    select 
        distinct tb_1_.ID 
    from BOOK as tb_1_ 
    inner join BOOK_STORE as tb_2_ 
        on tb_1_.STORE_ID = tb_2_.ID 
    where 
        tb_2_.NAME = ?
    ```

2. 
    ```sql
    delete from BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING 
    where BOOK_ID in(?, ?, ?)
    ```
3. 
    ```sql
    delete from BOOK 
    where ID in(?, ?, ?)
    ```

:::note
If you use table join in a delete statement, jimmer-sql will translate it to `select` + `delete`. First use the `select` statement with the table joins to query the id of the data to be deleted, and then use the [Delete command](./delete-command) to delete the data.

This scheme is valid for any database.
