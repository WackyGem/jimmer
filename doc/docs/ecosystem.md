Jimmer only focuses on the ORM itself, and does not provide auxiliary tools, such as producing entity interface definitions based on database structures.

Enthusiastic people have contributed related tools. So far, the projects included are:

|Project type|Supported languages|Project link|
|---|---|---|
|Intellij plugin|Java&Kotlin|https://github.com/ClearPlume/jimmer-generator|
|Maven plugin|Java|https://github.com/TokgoRonin/code-generator-jimmer|

Everyone is welcome to actively contribute related tools, and submit PR for me to include them in the list
