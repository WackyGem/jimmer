title: Join Features Specific to Kotlin

## Dilemma

In order to take full advantage of Kotlin's language features and optimize its development experience, Jimmer provides different APIs for Java and Kotlin, but they are essentially the same. 

However, outer joins are the only exception. For this detail, the behaviors of Java API and Kotlin API are different:

-   Java DSL
    Use `JoinType` to represent join type, which can be `INNER` *(default)*, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` or `FULL`

-   Kotlin DSL

    -   Properties with the same name as entity properties represent inner joins
    
    -   Properties with a `?` after the entity properties name represent left joins

    That is, Kotlin DSL does not support `RIGHT` and `FULL`. This sacrifice is a careful trade-off, in exchange for a more important feature for Kotlin: perfectly combining Kotlin's null safety and SQL DSL.

## Getting Started with DSL's Null Safety

The entity `BookStore` is defined as follows:

```kotlin
@Entity
interface BookStore {

    val name: String

    val website: String?

    // Omit other code
}
```

The precompiled code generates: 

```kotlin
public val KNonNullProps<BookStore>.name: KNonNullPropExpression<String>
    get() = get("name")

public val KNullableProps<BookStore>.name: KNullablePropExpression<String>
    get() = get("name")

public val KProps<BookStore>.website: KNullablePropExpression<String>
    get() = get("website")
```

Please ignore the details of the generated code for now. We can see many types containing `NonNull` or `Nullable`.

:::tip
In Jimmer's Kotlin SQL DSL, almost all AST types have both `NonNull` and `Nullable` implementations.

This means Kotlin SQL DSL has null safety features equivalent to Kotlin language itself. SQL-style query code has complete null safety self-checking capabilities.  
:::

Let's look at a simple example first:

```kotlin
val tuples = sqlClient
    .createQuery(BookStore::class) {
        select(
            table.name,
            table.website ❶
        )
    }
    .execute()
for ((name, website) in books) { ❷
    println("Length of name: ${name.length}")
    // Compile error  
    // highlight-next-line
    println("Length of website: ${website.length}") ❸
}
```

1.  Since `BookStore.website` is nullable, the type of the second column selected at ❶ is `String?` instead of `String`.
    The final return type of the query is `List<Tuple2<String, String?>>`.
   
2.  ❷ Loops through each tuple queried, destructuring into variables `name` and `website`.
    Since `tuples` is of type `List<Tuple2<String, String?>>`, here `website` is of type `String?`.
   
3.  ❸ Performs `.length` operation on potentially null `website`, causing compile error.

To fix this compile error, modify code at ❸ to change `.` to `?.`:

```kotlin 
println("Length of website: ${website?.length}")
```

## Null Safety in Table Joins

In the above, we learned the simplest null safety in SQL DSL through a very simple example.

Now, let's combine null safety with table join operations:

### Inner Join

```kotlin
val tuples = sqlClient
    .createQuery(BookStore::class) {
        select(
            table.name, 
            table.store.name ❶
        )
    }
    .execute()
for ((name, storeName) in books) { ❷
    println("Length of name: ${name.length}")
    println("Length of storeName: ${storeName.length}") ❸
}
```

-   ❶ Uses inner join to get parent object's name. The final return type of the query is `List<Tuple2<String, String>>`.

-   ❷ Destructures into variables `storeName` of type `String`, non-nullable. So code at ❸ compiles. 

### Left Join

Let's modify the code to change inner join to outer join:

```kotlin
val tuples = sqlClient
    .createQuery(BookStore::class) {
        select(
            table.name,
            table.`store?`.name ❶
        ) 
    }
    .execute()
for ((name, storeName) in books) { ❷
    println("Length of name: ${name.length}")
    // Compile error
    // highlight-next-line  
    println("Length of storeName: ${storeName.length}") ❸
}
```

-   ❶ Uses left join to get parent object.

    The precompiled code in `BookProps.kt` includes:

    ```kotlin
    public val KProps<Book>.store: KNonNullTable<BookStore>
        get() = join("store")

    public val KProps<Book>.`store?`: KNullableTable<BookStore>  
        get() = outerJoin("store")
    ```

    Unlike inner join `store`, outer join `store?` returns a table of type `KNullableTable`, i.e. nullable table. This is the effect of left join in SQL.

    The precompiled code in `BookStoreProps.kt` includes:

    ```kotlin
    public val KNonNullProps<BookStore>.name: KNonNullPropExpression<String>
        get() = get("name") ❹

    public val KNullableProps<BookStore>.name: KNullablePropExpression<String>
        get() = get("name") ❺
    ```

    The returned `KNullableTable` inherits from `KNullableProps` instead of `KNonNullProps`.

    So in the DSL, accessing `name` matches ❺ instead of ❹.

    That is, just `BookStore.name` being non-null is not enough, need to also consider if the table it is accessed from is non-null.

    Ultimately, Jimmer determines the second column in ❶ is `String?`, so the return type is `List<Tuple2<String, String?>>`.
  
-   ❷ Destructures into `storeName` of type `String?`, nullable. This must cause compile error at ❸.

To fix this compile error, modify code at ❸ to change `.` to `?.`: 

```kotlin
println("Length of storeName: ${storeName?.length}") ❸  
```
