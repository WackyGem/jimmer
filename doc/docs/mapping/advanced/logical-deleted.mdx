title: Logical Deletion

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Logical deletion, also known as soft deletion, does not actually delete data from the database. Instead, it creates the illusion that data has been deleted by hiding it. This leaves room for recovery in case of misoperation.

To enable logical deletion for entities, a flag property decorated with `org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.LogicalDeleted` needs to be added to indicate whether the data is normal or deleted.

Once a logical deletion property is configured for an entity:

-   By default, when developers call the API to delete an entity object, Jimmer does not actually delete the data with SQL `delete` statement. Instead, it uses `update` statement to set the logical deletion property of the entity to "deleted".

    Exception: Even if an entity has logical deletion property, Jimmer also provides APIs for developers to forcibly truly delete objects by passing additional parameters.
    
-   By default, all SQL queries against the entity will be automatically appended with `where soft_delete_flag <> deleted` condition to create the illusion that some data has been deleted.

    Exceptions:
    
    - Jimmer provides some convenience APIs that query entities *(or entity id sets)* by id *(or id sets)* without requiring users to create queries. This set of APIs ignores the soft deletion rules.

    - Jimmer can ignore logical deletion filtering rules *(not add filtering conditions)*; or even reverse logical deletion filtering rules *(add opposite filtering conditions to find deleted data only)*.
    
:::info
Logical deletion itself is a relatively fixed feature. In terms of automatically adding query filtering conditions, [Global Filters](../../query/global-filter) is a more general feature.

In fact, logical deletion itself is a built-in [Global Filter](../../query/global-filter) provided by Jimmer without requiring implementation by developers.
:::

## Usage

The logical deletion flag property can be one of the following types:

- boolean: must be non-null
- int: must be non-null 
- enum: must be non-null
- date: must be nullable

### boolean Type  

-   Use true to indicate deleted

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java title="Book.java"
    @Entity
    public interface Book {

        // highlight-next-line
        @LogicalDeleted("true")  
        boolean isDeleted();

        ...Omit other code...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin title="Book.kt"
    @Entity
    interface Book {

        // highlight-next-line
        @LogicalDeleted("true")
        val isDeleted: Boolean

        ...Omit other code...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

-   Use false to indicate deleted

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java title="Book.java"
    @Entity
    public interface Book {

        // highlight-next-line
        @LogicalDeleted("false")
        boolean isEnabled();

        ...Omit other code...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin title="Book.kt" 
    @Entity
    interface Book {

        // highlight-next-line
        @LogicalDeleted("false")
        val isEnabled: Boolean

        ...Omit other code...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
    
Here, in addition to the `value` parameter we configured for `@LogicalDeleted`, the annotation also has another parameter `restoredValue`:

-   `value`: The value of the field when the object is deleted.

-   `restoredValue`: The value of the field when the object is not deleted.

Obviously, `value` and `restoredValue` cannot be equal. 

:::tip
When this property has only two possible values *(boolean or enum with only two options)*, `restoredValue` can be omitted.
:::

Therefore, the annotations demonstrated in the above code are actually omissions of the `restoredValue` parameter:

-   `@LogicalDeleted("true")` is actually a shorthand for `@LogicalDeleted(value = "true", restoredValue = "false")`.

-   `@LogicalDeleted("false")` is actually a shorthand for `@LogicalDeleted(value = "false", restoredValue = "true")`.

:::info  
Whether omitted or explicitly specified by the developer, the `restoredValue` parameter has two roles:

-   The default value of this property when the object is first saved.

-   When data in deleted state is saved again and its state needs to be restored to normal, the value to which this property is automatically reset.

### int Type  

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="Book.java" 
@Entity
public interface Book {

    // highlight-next-line
    @LogicalDeleted(value = "1", restoredValue = "0")
    int state();

    ...Omit other code...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="Book.kt"
@Entity
interface Book {

    // highlight-next-line
    @LogicalDeleted(value = "1", restoredValue = "0")
    val state: Int

    ...Omit other code...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Enum Type

First, define the enum type to represent data status:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="BookState.java"
public enum BookState {
    INTIALIZED,  
    FROZEN,
    PUBLISHED,
    DELETED
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="BookState.kt"
enum class BookState {
    INTIALIZED,
    FROZEN,
    PUBLISHED,
    DELETED
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="Book.java" 
@Entity
public interface Book {

    // highlight-next-line
    @LogicalDeleted(
        value = "DELETED",
        restoredValue = "INTIALIZED"  
    )
    BookState state();

    ...Omit other code...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="Book.kt"
@Entity
interface Book {

    // highlight-next-line
    @LogicalDeleted(
        value = "DELETED",
        restoredValue = "INTIALIZED"
    )
    val state: BookState

    ...Omit other code...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
If the enum has only two options, `restoredValue` can be omitted.
::: 

:::info
For Jimmer's configuration related to saving enum properties, please refer to [Enum Mapping](./enum).
:::

### Date

-   Use non-null to indicate deleted, null to indicate not deleted

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java title="Book.java"
    @Entity
    public interface Book {

        // highlight-next-line
        @LogicalDeleted(value = "now", restoredValue = "null") 
        @Nullable
        LocalDateTime deletedTime();

        ...Omit other code...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin title="Book.kt"
    @Entity
    interface Book {

        // highlight-next-line
        @LogicalDeleted(value = "now", restoredValue = "null")
        val deletedTime: LocalDateTime?

        ...Omit other code...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

-   Use null to indicate deleted, non-null to indicate not deleted

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java title="Book.java"
    @Entity
    public interface Book {

        // highlight-next-line
        @LogicalDeleted(value = "null", restoredValue = "now")
        @Nullable
        LocalDateTime createdTime();

        ...Omit other code...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin title="Book.kt"
    @Entity
    interface Book {

        // highlight-next-line
        @LogicalDeleted(value = "null", restoredValue = "now")
        val createdTime: LocalDateTime?

        ...Omit other code...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
    
Where `now` is a special value defined by `@LogicalDeleted` that represents current time.

## Multi-View Cache Support  

:::caution
Logical deletion itself is a very simple feature. If it is only used at the SQL operation level, it is merely a simple query condition adding feature.

However, when used together with Jimmer's caching capabilities, since logical deletion itself is a built-in [Global Filter](../../query/global-filter), this will involve [Multi-View Cache](../../cache/multiview-cache) issues that developers need to be aware of.
:::

This article will not discuss what problems [Multi-View Cache](../../cache/multiview-cache) tries to solve and how to solve them. Please refer to related documents on [Multi-View Cache](../../cache/multiview-cache). This article briefly introduces how to enable multi-view cache for logical deletion properties:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="Book.java"
@Entity 
public interface Book {

    @LogicalDeleted(
        value = "true",
        // highlight-next-line
        useMultiViewCache = true  
    )
    boolean isDeleted();

    ...Omit other code...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="Book.kt"
@Entity
interface Book {

    @LogicalDeleted(
        value = "true",
        // highlight-next-line
        useMultiViewCache = true
    )
    val isDeleted: Boolean

    ...Omit other code...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
