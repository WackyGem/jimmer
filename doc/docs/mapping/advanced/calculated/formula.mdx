Simple formula properties are properties declared with `@org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.Formula`. There are two usages:

- Formula properties based on Java/Kotlin calculation
- Formula properties based on SQL calculation

:::note
Simple formula properties are designed for simple and fast calculations. For complex calculations, use [Complex Formula Properties](./transient) instead.
:::

In [Define Entity](../../../overview/get-started/define-entity.mdx), we defined two fields for `Author`: `firstName` and `lastName`.

Next, let's add a new property `fullName` to `Author`: 

```
fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName
```

Then we use two different ways, Java/Kotlin-based calculation and SQL-based calculation, to implement `Author.fullName`.

## Java/Kotlin-based Calculation

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">  

```java title="Author.java"
package com.example.model;

import org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.*;

@Entity
public interface Author {

    @Formula(dependencies = {"firstName", "lastName"})
    default String fullName() {
        return firstName() + ' ' + lastName(); 
    }

    ...Omit other properties...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="Author.kt"  
package com.example.model

import org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.*

@Entity
interface Author {

    @Formula(dependencies = ["firstName", "lastName"])
    val fullName: String
        get() = "$firstName $lastName"

    ...Omit other properties...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

It is easy to see that Java/Kotlin-based simple formula properties have the following characteristics:

- The property is not abstract (requires `default` keyword in Java) and directly provides calculation logic implementation.

- `@Formula`'s `dependencies` is specified, indicating that this property depends on `Author.firstName` and `Author.lastName`.

    That is, the dynamic entity must ensure the presence of both `firstName` and `lastName` properties to calculate `fullName`.
    
The usage is:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java 
Author author = authorRepository.findNullable(
    1L,
    AuthorFetcher.$
        // Query id (implicit + forced) and fullName  
        // highlight-next-line
        .fullName()
);
System.out.println(author);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val author = authorRepository.findNullable(
    1L,
    newFetcher(Author::class).by {
        // Query id (implicit + forced) and fullName
        // highlight-next-line
        fullName()
    }
);
println(author)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The executed SQL is:

```sql 
select
    tb_1_.ID,
    /* highlight-start */  
    tb_1_.FIRST_NAME,
    tb_1_.LAST_NAME
    /* highlight-end */
from AUTHOR as tb_1_
where tb_1_.ID = ?  
```

`fullName` is a formula property without corresponding field in the database, but depends on `firstName` and `lastName`. 
So this SQL queries `FIRST_NAME` and `LAST_NAME` to make its dependent properties present.  

Next, let's see what is printed:

```json
{"id":1,"fullName":"Eve Procello"}
```

We can see that after Jackson serialization (the `toString` method of entity objects is a shortcut for serialization), there is only `fullName` but no `firstName` and `lastName`.

This is because the object fetcher causes `firstName` and `lastName` to be indirectly fetched due to fetching `fullName`, but they are not directly fetched.

In this case, although the dynamic object has `firstName` and `lastName`, they are marked as invisible to Jackson and will not appear in the Jackson serialization result. 

:::note
If the object fetcher directly fetches `firstName` and `lastName`, they will definitely appear in the serialization result. Readers can try it themselves, no need to repeat here.

## SQL-based Calculation

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="Author.java"
package com.example.model;

import org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.*;

@Entity
public interface Author {

    @Formula(sql = "concat(%alias.FIRST_NAME, ' ', %alias.LAST_NAME)")
    String fullName();

    ...Omit other properties...
} 
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">  

```kotlin title="Author.kt"
package com.example.model

import org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.*

@Entity
interface Author {

    @Formula(sql = "concat(%alias.FIRST_NAME, ' ', %alias.LAST_NAME)")
    val fullName: String

    ...Omit other properties...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

It is easy to see that SQL-based simple formula properties have the following characteristics:

- The property is abstract.

- `@Formula`'s `sql` is specified as an SQL expression with a special token `%alias`

    Users cannot know the alias of the current table in the final SQL in advance, so Jimmer stipulates here that `%alias` represents the actual table column name.
    
The usage is:

<Tabs groupId="language"> 
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
Author author = authorRepository.findNullable(  
    1L,
    AuthorFetcher.$
        // Query id (implicit + forced) and fullName
        // highlight-next-line
        .fullName()
);
System.out.println(author);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin 
val author = authorRepository.findNullable(
    1L,
    newFetcher(Author::class).by {
        // Query id (implicit + forced) and fullName
        // highlight-next-line
        fullName()
    }
);
println(author)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The generated SQL is:  

```sql
select
    tb_1_.ID,
    /* Here, `%alias` in @Formula.sql is replaced with `tb_1_` */ 
    /* highlight-next-line */
    concat(tb_1_.FIRST_NAME, ' ', tb_1_.LAST_NAME)
from AUTHOR as tb_1_
where tb_1_.ID = ?
```

The final printed result is:
```json  
{"id":1,"fullName":"Eve Procello"}
```

### Comparison with Java/Kotlin-based Simple Formula

Compared with Java/Kotlin-based simple formula, SQL-based simple formula has one disadvantage and one advantage:

- Disadvantage: If the object fetcher fetches `firstName`, `lastName` and `fullName` at the same time, it will cause the final SQL to query three columns: 
    
    `tb_1_.FIRST_NAME`, `tb_1_.LAST_NAME` and `concat(tb_1_.FIRST_NAME, ' ', tb_1_.LAST_NAME)`.
    
    Obviously, the returned data contains redundancy and is wasteful.
    
- Advantage: Java/Kotlin-based formula properties can only be used as fields to be fetched by object fetchers, and cannot be used by SQL DSL.

    SQL-based formula properties will be generated into the strongly typed SQL DSL API by the code generator, available for SQL DSL, such as:

    Java's `where(table.fullName().eq("Eve Procello"))` or Kotlin's `where(table.fullName eq "Eve Procello")`

    :::tip  
    Among all formula properties, only SQL-based simple formula properties can be used by SQL DSL.
    
    It is recommended to use databases that support function indexes and use them in combination with function indexes.
    :::
    
Therefore, it is recommended to carefully consider whether @Formula formula properties should be based on Java/Kotlin calculation or SQL calculation.
