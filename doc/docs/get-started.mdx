Running the demos that come with the framework is always the fastest way to get started, 
especially `example/java/jimmer-sql` or `/example/kotlin/jimmer-sql-kt`
:::

## Essential Information to Run the Example!
Like the strong-typed SQL DSL implementations such as
[JOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/)，[JPA2.0 Criteria](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gjitv.html)，[QueryDSL](http://querydsl.com/)，[MyBatis-Flex](https://github.com/mybatis-flex/mybatis-flex)，[Fluent-MyBatis](https://github.com/atool/fluent-mybatis),
Jimmer needs to generate more source code based on user code.

-   For Java, this means annotation processor.
-   For Kotlin, this means KSP.

When users first use an IDE (such as IntelliJ) to open the project's accompanying examples, 
they will find that some classes that should have been automatically generated do not exist.

**Don't be afraid at this point, click the Run/Debug button, and all errors will disappear automatically**
