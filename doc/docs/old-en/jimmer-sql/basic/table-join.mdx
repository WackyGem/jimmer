Jimmer's table joins are designed for very complex queries, it have the following features:

1.  Without explicitly creating table joins, the natural fluent property reference path represents complex multi-table joins, such as:

    `where(table.books.authors.company.city.name eq "ChengDu")`

2.  Table joins that are never used are automatically ignored and do not appear in the final SQL.

3.  For joined associated object, if only its id property is accessed, jimmer will further ignore more unnecessary join.

4.  Conflicting table joins in different paths will be automatically merged.

This article will introduce the table joins, it contains four parts

-   Dynamic join
-   Phantom join
-   Half join
-   Inverse join

## Dynamic join

### Example

Let's look at an example of a dynamic join.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
@Repository
public class BookRepository {

    private final JSqlClient sqlClient;

    public BookRepository(JSqlClient sqlClient) {
        this.sqlClient = sqlClient;
    }

    public List<Book> findBooks(
        @Nullable String name,
        @Nullable String storeName,
        @Nullable String storeWebsite
    ) {
        BookTable book = BookTable.$;
        
        return sqlClient
            .createQuery(book)
            .whereIf(
                name != null,
                () -> book.name().eq(name)
            )
            .whereIf(
                storeName != null,
                () -> book
                    // highlight-next-line
                    .store() // α
                    .name()
                    .eq(storeName)
            )
            .whereIf(
                storeWebsite != null,
                () -> book
                    // highlight-next-line
                    .store() // β
                    .website()
                    .eq(storeWebsite)
            )
            .select(book)
            .execute();
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
@Repository
class BookRepository(
    private val sqlClient: KSqlClient
) {
    fun findBooks(
        name: String?,
        storeName: String?,
        storeWebsite: String?
    ): List<Book> =
        sqlClient
            .createQuery(Book::class) {
                name?.let {
                    where(table.name eq it)
                }
                storeName?.let {
                    where(
                        table
                            // highlight-next-line
                            .store // α
                            .name eq it
                    )
                }
                storeName?.let {
                    where(
                        table
                            // highlight-next-line
                            .store // β
                            .website eq it
                    )
                }
                select(table)
            }
            .execute()
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This is a typical dynamic query, and all three query parameters are allowed to be null.

- `name` is specified, but `storeName` and `storeWebsite` are still null.

    At this time, the code at `α` and `β` will not be executed, and the resulting SQL will not contain any joins.

    ```sql
    select 
        tb_1_.ID, 
        tb_1_.NAME, 
        tb_1_.EDITION, 
        tb_1_.PRICE, 
        tb_1_.STORE_ID 
    from BOOK as tb_1_ 
        where tb_1_.NAME = ?
    ```
- `name` and `storeName` are specified, but `storeWebsite` is still null.

    At this time, the table join at `α` takes effect but the code at `β` will not be executed, and the final generated SQL is as follows.

    ```sql
    select 
        tb_1_.ID, 
        tb_1_.NAME, 
        tb_1_.EDITION, 
        tb_1_.PRICE, 
        tb_1_.STORE_ID 
    from BOOK as tb_1_ 
    /* highlight-start */
    inner join BOOK_STORE as tb_2_ 
        on tb_1_.STORE_ID = tb_2_.ID
    /* highlight-end */ 
    where 
        tb_1_.NAME = ? 
    and 
        tb_2_.NAME = ?
    ```
- `name` and `storeWebsite` are specified, but `storeName` is still null.

    At this time, the table join at `β` takes effect but the code at `α` will not be executed, and the final generated SQL is as follows.

    ```sql
    select 
        tb_1_.ID, 
        tb_1_.NAME, 
        tb_1_.EDITION, 
        tb_1_.PRICE, 
        tb_1_.STORE_ID 
    from BOOK as tb_1_ 
    /* highlight-start */
    inner join BOOK_STORE as tb_2_ 
        on tb_1_.STORE_ID = tb_2_.ID 
    /* highlight-end */
    where 
        tb_1_.NAME = ? 
    and 
        tb_2_.WEBSITE = ?
    ```

- Specify all parameters, `name`, `storeName` and `storeWebsite` are non-null.
    
    At this time, the table joins at `α` and `β` take effect, this situation is called a join conflict.
    
    This conflict does not cause any problems, because in the final SQL, the conflicting table joins will be merged into one instead of join multiple times.

    ```sql
    select 
        tb_1_.ID, 
        tb_1_.NAME, 
        tb_1_.EDITION, 
        tb_1_.PRICE, 
        tb_1_.STORE_ID 
    from BOOK as tb_1_ 
        /* highlight-start */
        inner join BOOK_STORE as tb_2_ on 
            tb_1_.STORE_ID = tb_2_.ID 
        /* highlight-end */
    where 
        tb_1_.NAME = ? 
    and 
        tb_2_.NAME = ? 
    and 
        tb_2_.WEBSITE = ?
    ```

:::info
summary

1. There is no need to use local variables to remember join objects like other ORMs, temporary join objects can be created and used anywhere in SQL.

2. More importantly, there is no need to consider whether there is some conflict between these join objects, conflicting join objects will be automatically merged.

This feature makes jimmer-sql extremely suitable for implementing complex dynamic queries. It is also one of the motivations for the creation of the jimmer-sql project.
:::

Also, if a table join is created but not used, the table join will be ignored and will not be generated in the final SQL.

### Conflict merge rules

The above example is very simple, the table join in has only one layer. In fact, it is possible to create deeper join objects

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
where(
    store // Assuming that the type of `store` is 
          // BookStoreTableEx, so collection join is allowed
        // highlight-next-line
        .books().authors() // multi-level join
        .firstName()
        .eq("X")
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
where(
    table // Assuming that the type of `table` is 
          // TableEx<BookStore>, so collection join is allowed
        // highlight-next-line
        .books.authors // multi-level join
        .firstName eq "X"
)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Or

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
where(
    author // Assuming that the type of `author` is 
           // BookStoreTableEx, and collection join is allowed
        // highlight-next-line
        .books().store() // multi-level join
        .name()
        .eq("X")
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
where(
    table // Assuming that the type of `table` is 
          // BookStoreTableEx, and collection join is allowed
        // highlight-next-line
        .books.store // multi-level join
        .name eq "X"
)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

It can be seen that the join object is actually a path of arbitrary length, which can also be called a join path. The join path contains from 1 to infinity of join nodes.

In order to make the description more general, let's look at three relatively long join paths *(there is no such long table join path in an actual project, just to illustrate)*.

1. a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> g
2. a -> b -> c -> h -> i -> j
3. a -> x -> y -> z -> a-> b -> c -> d

In order to eliminate conflicts, jimmer-sql will merge the nodes in these paths into a tree
```
-+-a
 |
 +----+-b
 |    |
 |    \----+-c 
 |         |
 |         +----+-d
 |         |    |
 |         |    \----+-e
 |         |         |
 |         |         \----+-f
 |         |              |
 |         |              \------g
 |         |
 |         \----+-h
 |              |
 |              \----+-i
 |                   |
 |                   \------j
 |
 \----+-x
      |
      \----+-y
           |
           \----+-z
                |
                \----+-a
                     |
                     \----+-b
                          |
                          \----+-c
                               |
                               \------d
```

jimmer-sql will generate the join clause in the final SQL based on this tree.

Another rule that needs to be explained is the join type. The method that creates the join object has a parameter to specify the join type, for example. For example, deveoper can create left join like this:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
book.store(JoinType.LEFT);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
book.`store?`
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The join type merging rules are as follows:

- If the join types of the conflicting join nodes are all the same, the join type remain unchanged after the merge.
- Otherwise, the merged join type is inner join.

## Phantom join

Phantom join is a very simple optimization concept, which can be understood by comparing it with ordinary join.

Let's first look at an example of a ordinary table join.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
BookTable book = BookTable.$;

List<Book> books = sqlClient
    .createQuery(book)
    .where(book.store().name().eq("MANNING"))
    .select(book)
    .execute();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val books = sqlClient
    .createQuery(Book::class) {
        where(table.store.name eq "MANNING")
        select(table)    
    }
    .execute()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The generated SQL is as follows:

```sql
select 
    tb_1_.ID, 
    tb_1_.NAME, 
    tb_1_.EDITION, 
    tb_1_.PRICE, 
    tb_1_.STORE_ID 
from BOOK as tb_1_ 
    /* highlight-start */
    inner join BOOK_STORE as tb_2_ 
        on tb_1_.STORE_ID = tb_2_.ID
    /* highlight-end */     
where 
    tb_2_.NAME = ?
```

Now, let's look at an example of phantom join

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
BookTable book = BookTable.$;

List<Book> books = sqlClient
    .createQuery(book)
    .where(
        book
        .store()
        // highlight-next-line
        .id() // Only id is accessed
        .eq(2L)
    )
    .select(book)
    .execute();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val books = sqlClient
    .createQuery(Book::class) {
        where(
            table
            .store
            // highlight-next-line
            .id // Only access id 
            eq 2L
        )
        select(table)
    }
    .execute()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

At this time, the generated SQL is as follows:

```sql
select 
    tb_1_.ID, 
    tb_1_.NAME, 
    tb_1_.EDITION, 
    tb_1_.PRICE, 
    tb_1_.STORE_ID 
from BOOK as tb_1_ 
    where tb_1_.STORE_ID = ?
```

We don't see any table joins in the SQL, we only see the condition `tb_1_.STORE_ID = ?` based on a foreign key.

Reason: For many-to-one associations based on foreign key, the id of the parent table is actually the foreign key of the child table.

:::info
If join object based on foreign key is created but no properties of the associated object other than id is accessed, the join object will be treated as a phantom join. 

Phantom join will not generate join clause in SQL.
:::

## Half join

Half join is a similar concept to a phantom join, but for associations based on middle table.

Let's first look at a normal join based on middle table

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
BookTable book = BookTable.$;

List<Long> bookIds = sqlClient
    .createQuery(book)
    .where(
        book
            .asTableEx()
            .authors()
            .firstName()
            .eq("Alex")
    )
    .select(book.id())
    .distinct()
    .execute();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val bookIds = sqlClient
    .createQuery(Book::class) {
        where(
            table
                .asTableEx()
                .authors
                .firstName eq "Alex"
        )
        select(table.id)
    }
    .distinct()
    .execute()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The generated SQL is as follows:
```sql
select 
    distinct tb_1_.ID 
from BOOK as tb_1_ 
/* highlight-start */
inner join BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING as tb_2_ 
    on tb_1_.ID = tb_2_.BOOK_ID 
inner join AUTHOR as tb_3_ on 
    tb_2_.AUTHOR_ID = tb_3_.ID
/* highlight-end */ 
where tb_3_.FIRST_NAME = ?
```

We see that the association based on the middle table will generate two SQL join clauses:

- Step1: Join to middle table
    `inner join BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING as tb_2_ on tb_1_.ID = tb_2_.BOOK_ID `

- Step2: join to target table
    `inner join AUTHOR as tb_3_ on tb_2_.AUTHOR_ID = tb_3_.ID`

Next, let's look at half join

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
BookTable book = BookTable.$;

List<Long> bookIds = sqlClient
    .createQuery(book)
    .where(
        book
            .asTableEx()
            .authors()
            // highlight-next-line
            .id() // Only access id
            .eq(2L)
    )
    .select(book.id())
    .distinct()
    .execute();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val bookIds = sqlClient
    .createQuery(Book::class) {
        where(
            (table as KNullableTableEx<Book>)
                .authors
                // highlight-next-line
                .id // Only access id 
                eq 2L
        )
        select(table.id)
    }
    .distinct()
    .execute()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

At this time, the generated SQL is as follows:

```sql
select 
    distinct tb_1_.ID 
from BOOK as tb_1_ 
/* highlight-start */
inner join BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING as tb_2_ 
    on tb_1_.ID = tb_2_.BOOK_ID 
/* highlight-end */
where tb_2_.AUTHOR_ID = ?
```

At this time, we only see one SQL join clause, not two

Reason: The id of the associated object is actually a foreign key of middle table.

:::info
If join object based on middle table is created but no properties of the associated object other than id is accessed, the join object will be treated as a half join. 

Half join will generate only one join clause point to middle table in SQL, not two.
:::

## Inverse join

All table joins we've discussed so far only apply when java property is already defined in the entity interface.

If the developer defines a bidirectional association between entity interfaces

`A <--> B`

We can join from either end to the other, either from `A` to `B` or from `B` to `A`.

However, sometimes developers only define one-way associations in entity interface.

`A --> B`
Now, we can only join from `A` to B, not from `B` to `A`.

Admittedly, subqueries can solve all problems. However, jimmer-sql still allows you to solve this problem with special table joins, which are called inverse joins.

To better illustrate the inverse join, let's first look at normal join.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
where(
    table
        // Normal join
        // highlight-next-line
        .authors
        .firstName eq "Alex"
)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

There are two ways to write the inverse join that is completely equivalent to it

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

1.  Weak typing    

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java
    where(
        book
            // Reverse `Auhtor.books`,
            // it's actually `Book.authors`
            // highlight-next-line
            .inverseJoin(Author.class, "books")
            .firstName()
            .eq("Alex")
    );
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    
    ```kotlin
    where(
        table
            // Reverse `Auhtor.books`,
            // it's actually `Book.authors`
            // highlight-next-line
            .inverseJoin(Author::class, "books")
            .firstName eq "Alex"
    )
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2.  Strong typing

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    
    ```java
    where(
        book
            // Reverse `Auhtor.books`,
            // it's actually `Book.authors`
            // highlight-next-line
            .inverseJoin(AuthorProps.BOOKS)
            .firstName()
            .eq("Alex")
    );
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    
    ```kotlin
    where(
        table
            // Reverse `Auhtor.books`,
            // it's actually `Book.authors`
            // highlight-next-line
            .inverseJoin(Author::books)
            .firstName eq "Alex"
    )
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

:::info

Notice

While inverse joins are easy to understand, the code is relatively obscure to read. Because of this, it should not to be abused.

It should only be used in some special cases, such as

1. The definition of the entity interface belongs to the third party, not the code that can be controlled by your team, and the third-party entity only defines a one-way association, no bidrectional association.

2. When developing some generic frameworks, it cannot be assumed that users defined bidirectional associations.

However, in business system development, you should defining bidirectional associations in entity interfaces instead of using inverse joins.
